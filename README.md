- 👋 Hi, I’m Dmitrij@bertramvays
 
- 👀 I am interested in various areas of life, the suppression of which is sometimes difficult 
         to think about. My dream is to become a software developer and take part in the 
         creation of some great project. I started learning programming with Pascal when I was
         at school. Then there was a big break. I began to seriously study programming a couple
         of years ago with the Python programming language, which I master to this day. 
         In addition to programming, I do not forget about spiritual development, and I also 
         enjoy cycling and hiking in the wilderness.
 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL and Django framework.
 
- 💞️ I am looking for collaborations in deep learning of programming and in determining the direction
         of learning. Programming is a big ocean and it is difficult to make a choice on your own. 
         I look in the direction of Machine learning, but I think it will be difficult there without
         a mentor. I am also interested in application development.
